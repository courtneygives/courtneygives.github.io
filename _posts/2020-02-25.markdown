Walking past a window-painted sign this morning, I stopped to stare for a moment and touch the paint. My husband waited patiently as I did this, and I jokingly said to him, "that's my dream job - painting signs." I should have known that he would never hear that as a joke, but would respond without reservation by saying I could and should absolutely try to make that happen. That's my Alex. He will laugh at my jokes, if they're any good, and even sometimes when they suck-- but he knew that this was no joke.
