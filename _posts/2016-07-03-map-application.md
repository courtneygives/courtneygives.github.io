### A food resources map for the North Minneapolis community

![Nile of the North photo](/media/notn-cover.jpg){:.right-img  width="500px"}

At [Prime](http://primeacademy.io), my final three weeks were dedicated to building this map, with four fellow students. Prime pairs students with organizations in a truly mutually beneficial arrangement: The organization gets a free application built rapidly, and the students gain a hugely valuable learning experience while creating it.

The map is a full-stack web application designed for [Project Sweetie Pie](http://www.projectsweetiepie.org/), the non-profit organization dedicated to the North Minneapolis community. The application uses an interactive map of the N. Minneapolis area food resources to engage the community.

My role in the group consistently gravitated toward styling, but we all thought it was important that we could speak to all aspects of building the app. It was my (perhaps foolish) idea to use [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) for our forms and buttons-- I say foolish because I ended up changing almost everything about the Material styles, and they do not make that easy. At least we got the neat animations on mouse clicks.

Most of my work can be seen in the user administration areas (I snuck yellow in wherever I could get away with it).

There is a lot about the project that I would love to touch-up, tweak, throw out and start over.... but this was done in three weeks, and I am proud of it because our clients are happy with it. Also, I never seem to want to call something *done*, because nothing is ever perfect. At some point you gotta just "ship it."

## Technology used

Javascript, Node, Express, Passport, Angular, MapBox, Angular Material, and PostgreSQL.

The map is live at [north-nile.herokuapp.com](http://north-nile.herokuapp.com).
