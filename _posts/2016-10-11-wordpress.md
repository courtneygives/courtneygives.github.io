When asked to create a web site for a jewelry artist that used a content management system (CMS), I began greedily learning about every CMS out there. Except for Wordpress. I tried Python-based DjangoCMS and a couple of Rails-based tools, found a lot of pages that ranked CMSs by usability, documentation, ease of installation, etc... and soon, reluctantly, circled back to Wordpress.

There wasn't a lot wrong with the CMSs I tried, but none of them had any real advantage over Wordpress that didn't go something like "not written in PHP!!"

I am interested in writing Python or Ruby code far more than I am in PHP, but that is not how one should base a decision like this. I went back to Wordpress because it was going to be best for my client for a couple of reasons:

- First, she knows how to use Wordpress
- Second, there are a LOT of plugins and tools for Wordpress

Those are sort of disappointing reasons to choose a tool, because as a developer, I confess, I want to use the coolest, shiniest thing. But if I want people to be able to use the things I develop, I need to avoid certain shiny things that may be fun for me, and really confusing and unnecessary for them. I also need to be sure that my reason for using or not using something contains very few instances of the word "cool."

To save myself some pain while I was being indecisive about content management systems, I initially developed the site for the jeweller in just HTML/SCSS. The [conversion to Wordpress-PHP](https://github.com/Team-Ives/shinysea) could easily be done later. The [test deployment](http://courtney.ives.mn/coleman-site-draft/) was just slapped up on GitHub Pages in Jekyll (very cool) for her review.

So the answer to why Wordpress is pretty much... "because the client will like it," and that's all the answer you need.
