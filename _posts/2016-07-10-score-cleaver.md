Over the July 4th weekend, [my husband](http://alex.ives.mn) and I built an Android application and uploaded it to the Play Store. This weekend, we added several improvements, and it looks like [version 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.ives.scorecleaver) is already pushed to the Play Store.

## What does it do, Courtney?

It's a score-keeping app, specifically for the card game [Star Realms](http://www.starrealms.com/), a fairly simple deck building game that we like to play.
