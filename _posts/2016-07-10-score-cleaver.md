Over the July 4th weekend, [my husband](http://alex.ives.mn) and I built an Android application and uploaded it to the Play Store. This weekend, we added several improvements, and it looks like [version 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.ives.scorecleaver) is already pushed to the Play Store.

## What does it do, Courtney?

It's a score-keeping app, specifically for the card game [Star Realms](http://www.starrealms.com/), a fairly simple deck building game -- it's pretty fun! Only problem: Score keeping with the provided cards is not fun.

Using Android Studio has been kind of terrifying, but quickly became more familiar with Alex barking over my shoulder to *click this* and *type that*.

Getting to work in Java has been very cool-- it's a true object-oriented language... something I thought JavaScript was, but it turns out that it doesn't go as far as Java.

## Why did you call it "Score Cleaver"?

Cause "score keeper" is taken, and this sounds kind of like it, but more badass.
