### Shocker:
I didn't get accepted to any of the graduate schools I applied to.

As upsetting as that has been, I take (a little) comfort in knowing that I'm very much not alone, here.

Resilience and adaptability are my specialties. Still, I have to admit feeling destroyed, not having really believed this would happen. I applied to three speech-language pathology programs... all of which have a less than 20% acceptance rate.

### So, what now, genius?

I don't know if or when I will apply again. And... Not to give anyone whiplash here, but, I am learning to program.

**Oh, come on... really?**

Yeah! I just... need to do something else for a while. I need to pay off some student loans, and feel like a useful person.

My husband is a software engineer, and I've always gotten along with his type. He and our friends have been encouraging me to try picking up a coding language like *Clojure* or *Ruby* and have said I could really be good at it because my eyes don't entirely glaze over when these guys start talking about their jobs.

***Bonus***

The world of speech-language therapy is in dire need of people who know how to code (and I'm not sure they realize that, yet).

### How does one just *learn to code*?

Ah! There is some good stuff out there for those who wish to start coding. I have a decent background in nonspecific tech-savviness, but for all tents and purses, I'm a beginner. The following are really useful sites to check out:

### Code Combat
[![Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/images/pages/base/logo.png)](http://codecombat.com/)

Code combat is a game that teaches code, and it's very fun. You have a choice of language to use, including Python, Clojure, JavaScript, Io, Lua, and CoffeeScript. When you really get good, you can contribute to their entirely open-source code. **Note:** After completing a handful of levels, it will prompt you to subscribe, but there are plenty of free levels. All you need to do to keep playing is close out of the prompt, and click on the next level.

### Codecademy

Codecademy is a well designed source for interactive tutorials that are engaging and very helpful. They have too many tutorials to list here, so, they probably have the discipline you're looking to learn about.

### Udacity

Udacity has a wide range of online courses, not limited to the field of computer science. They have partnered with university to bring the internet free courses that are very well put together. Browse their site to see all the good stuff you can learn there.
