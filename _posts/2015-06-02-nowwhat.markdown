**Shocker:** I didn't get accepted to any of the graduate schools I applied to.

As upsetting as that has been, I take (a little) comfort in knowing that I'm very much not alone, here.

Resilience and adaptability are my specialties. Still, I have to admit feeling destroyed, not having really believed this would happen. I applied to three speech-language pathology programs... all of which have a less than 20% acceptance rate.

**So, what now, genius?**

Well... Not to give anyone whiplash here, but, I am learning to program.

**Oh, come on... really?**

Yeah! I just... need to do something else for a while. I need to pay off some student loans, and feel like a useful person.

My husband is a software engineer, and I've always gotten along with his type. He and our friends have been encouraging me to try picking up a coding language like *Clojure* or *Ruby* and have said I could really be good at it because my eyes don't entirely glaze over when these guys start talking about their jobs.

***Bonus***

The world of speech-language therapy is in dire need of people who know how to code (and I'm not sure they realize that, yet).

**How does one just *learn to code*?**

Ah! There is some good stuff out there for those who wish to start coding. I have a decent background in nonspecific tech-savviness, but for all tents and purses, I'm a beginner. The following are really useful sites to check out:
