Original post: 05/26/2017

I've created a new site design using Bootstrap, and I'm in the process of converting it to be Liquid/Jekyll compatible.

**Update, October 11th, 2016:**

So, as you no doubt have noticed, my site does not look like the above picture. It did, briefly, but I thought it needed to be (dramatically) different for a number of reasons. The grid thing in the picture above is still very dear to my heart, but despite the wonderousness of Bootstrap, it did not function well at all. It worked poorly vertically, to be exact. Anyway.

This is how it ended up (in case it's years later and this site is totally different again).

**Update, October 9th- uh wow, almost exactly a year later...**

This site design has got to go! I will be working on that, while I have some extra time on my hands. I'll be sure keep the above photos around in case I want to laugh at myself next year. It'll be a tradition!
