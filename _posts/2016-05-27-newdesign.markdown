I've created a new site design using Bootstrap, and I'm in the process of converting it to be Liquid/Jekyll compatible.

Here's a picture of it:

**Update, October 11th, 2016:**
So, as you no doubt have noticed, my site does not look like this. It did, briefly, but I thought it needed to be (dramatically) different for a number of reasons. The grid thing in the picture above is still very dear to my heart, but despite the wonderousness of Bootstrap, it did not function well at all. It worked poorly vertically, to be exact. Anyway.

This is how it ended up (in case it's years later and this site is totally different again).
